                    UBCMUN strives to provide a platform for students all over the world to be educated about the inner workings of the United Nations, the world's largest and most diverse international organization. In true spirit of the UN, we expose students, known as delegates at the conference to exchange ideas, collaborate with one another, and resume the highest level of diplomacy. Our goal is to provide an environment to educate students about diplomacy and current global issues. We believe UBCMUN is a fantastic opportunity for participants to develop their public speaking, research, negotiating, and written and verbal communication skills.
